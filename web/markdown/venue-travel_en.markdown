## Getting to Toronto

Toronto has 2 major airports. Toronto Pearson is the international airport and is the location for almost all the major domestic and international airlines. It's about a 35 minute drive from Toronto Pearson to the University of Toronto, but be aware that downtown Toronto traffic is busy all day and is particularly busy during peak rush hour. Allow at least an hour for travel time from the airport. The Union Pearson Express train is also an good option to get downtown from Pearson.
